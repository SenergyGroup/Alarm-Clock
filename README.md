# Alarm-Clock
Python alarm clock GUI using Tkinter

This alarm clock will play an mp3 file of your choice at 06:30 AM. This is the same time I wake up every day, but you can change the time of the alarm to whenever you would like to wake up. To do this, locate the setAlarm() function. Then, within the dt6_30 variable, locate the datetime and switch out the hours, minutes, and seconds to your desired wakeup time.

This alarm clock was built to give me the motivation to wake up, so it is fairly personalized. Additional functionality to change the alarm time will come in latter updates.
